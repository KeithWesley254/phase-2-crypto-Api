      "comment": "If I don't make it home, please remember it wasn't because I didn't try. The last thing I wanted was to make you cry. I wanted more than anything to make it back to you, but there was a job I just had to do. As you were sleeping through the night, We woke to the sound of gunfire; and I knew this would be my last fight. It's my job to keep you safe and free, And to do that I will give every ounce of me. I am a soldier who will defend until the very end, But that comes at a cost that I know I can't mend. Keep a picture of me beside the bed and kiss me goodnight. Imagine my arms around you, holding you tight. Don't forget how my lips felt on yours. Or my soft caress as our clothes fell to the floor. Remember the warmth of my breathe as I whispered, 'I love you,' in your ear. Just because I'm gone, my love doesn't disappear. I know I broke my promise to be here to wipe away every tear. You've cried a million of them every time you wished I were still here. Please forgive me for leaving you so soon, But my country called and needed me, too."
